# ImageVault.EPiServer.UI

Contains UI components for ImageVault Connect for Episerver

## Known issues

### Custom views web.config
This package contains default [display templates][1] for the ImageVault properties when using MVC. 
These templates are included in the modules views folder (/modules/_protected/ImageVault.EPiServer.UI/views).

Upon installation, the web.config from the /views folder is copied to the modules views folder. If you 
change the web.config in the /views folder, these changes are not automatically updated in the modules 
views folder. Be advised to update it manually if needed.
